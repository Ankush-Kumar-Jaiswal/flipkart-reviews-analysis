8,3,Does the job,I see my muscles recover so fast after taking this. At first the taste was good. But as soon as u use it for 3 or 4 days the taste becomes worse. And the shaker produces an unpleasant smell because of this flavor which I did not see in the Rich Chocolate flavor. Go for Rich Chocolate it tastes the same when u take it for the first time and at the end of the pack. And initially I had some stomach bloating and upset issues. Posting this review after 20 days of use.READ MORE,Does the job

3,4,Wonderful,"I am a gym novice and Its my first time using whey, and I feel satisfied with the results. It would be better if you combine it with micronised creatine (before workout) and consume this post-workout for better muscle recovery. Also maintain a balanced diet with the necessary amount of fruits and vegetables to avoid indigestion of whey.I would give it a 5 rating but I want to try this for 2-3 months and see if its worth it.READ MORE",Wonderful

Honestly I can't tell what will be the effect on your body if you are reading this, but acts on me quite effectively. The taste is lower on sweetness which is good. The mixability is very nice.

9,5,Excellent,"For those people (like me) who have bloating issues after taking whey. This is the best product for those, completely solved my bloating issue after having a scoop. But this product is costly. So, I would recommend take whey fuel one(chocolate) instead for beginners and one who doesn't suffer Bloating issues.READ MORE",Excellent
10,4,Worth the money,"Product is Very Good in quality and taste. I liked it. I am consuming it from last 6 months. Effective results but it is Concentrate Form. So if you need Better results then go for Isolate or blend whey. Taste wise and mixability are very good.

1,5,Awesome,"I’ve just ordered this Protien and this is the one which I will stick for a long time. Honestly have tried almost all but none mix well if they do they are expensive to buy, few which are cheap give you a gastric problem or make you feel like throwing up dirty burp feeling. This product is has a good price and excellent for lean muscle building.  I don’t review in general this is my 1st review for any Protien. It’s worth every penny. Just workout regular or 5 times a week.READ MORE",Awesome

5,1,Useless product,I have used ON 3 years back and didn't experience any side effect's or nausea effects. I started working out 2 months back and was looking for a cheaper substitute of ON. I went for MB. After having a scoop of protein the first effect i noticed was bloating and second was nausea. My dumping cycle got all wrong. On the third day of consumption i vomitted after feeling bloated and nausea. This ain't a promotion post for ON but I had the worst experience with MB biozyme.READ MORE,Useless product
